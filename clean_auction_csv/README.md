### clean_auction_csv

AWS Î»-function to:

 - get/read today's raw csv from S3
 - clean it:
     - format fields (datetime to UTC, strip away chars in OGM, ...)
     - find and remove bad lines (send out warning)
     - mark suspicious bids
 - filter it:
     - remove rows from own domains and emails
 - save to S3 on /clean_csv (which will trigger the diff-fn):
     - rename clean_csv/latest.csv -> clean_csv/yesterday.csv
     - upload new to clean_csv/latest.csv

That's all...
